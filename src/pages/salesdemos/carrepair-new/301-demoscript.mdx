| **Talking Points**      | In the road to digital transformation, every organization seeks to move faster than before. But going fast without the right approach, guided by real-world operational data, has caused 70% of digital transformations to fail. A new approach with automation and continuous improvement fed by AI algorithms is required. IBM Cloud Pak for Integration is a hybrid integration solution that provides an automated and closed-loop lifecycle across multiple styles of enterprise integration. With IBM Cloud Pak for Integration, companies can speed integration development, reduce costs and maintain enhanced security, governance and availability. Let's see IBM Cloud Pak for Integration in action. Here I have a cloud version of the product on IBM Cloud. Let me log in here.|

<br/>

| **Create from an asset** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Click **Create from an Asset**. |
| **Talking Points**      | Here we are on the designer tooling. This is where we can create all of our API integration flows and also manage our connectivity to our services and endpoints. At the moment, there’s nothing here yet, so let’s build some integration logic. Let's see how simple to create our flow from the Asset Repository.|
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![import1](./images/demoscript-createfromasset.png) |

<br/>

| **Review properties** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Show the **Properties view** and click on **Operations** |
| **Talking Points**      | Designer builds your API for you – you don’t need to worry about OpenAPI specs or Swagger editors – it’s all built in.  These are the fields we are going to use for our API. Note that we tell our API which field is the key – in our case, CaseReference.|
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review1](./images/demoscript-review-props.png) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.2 - Review operations</summary>

<br/>

| **Review operations** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Show the **Operations view** and click on **Edit flow** |
| **Talking Points**      | On Operations view are the actions that the API exposes with the data. In this demo, we’re going to build just one operation – we can add more if we wish. Let's check the flow logic.|
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review2](./images/demoscript-operations.png) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.3 - Review the flow</summary>

<br/>

| **Review the flow** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Initially **close** the Request dialog. Explain the Flow and Scroll through all of the connectors in the flow. After that, open the **Request** again, by clicking the first step of the flow. |
| **Talking Points**      | Here we have our demo flow. In the designer flow editor, we are able to edit and change our flow.   We are a Car Repair company: We take in vehicles with problems and repair them. We want to create an API which enables customers to send us photos of their cars along with descriptions of what needs to be done. With this information, we will create a case in Salesforce and use Watson to analyze if the customer is angry or upset. Let's explore our flow in details.|
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review2](./images/demoscript-review-flow.png) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.4 - Review Request</summary>

<br/>

| **Review Request** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Show the *Request* dialog (1). Click to *open* the **if** step (2). |
| **Talking Points**      | Our flow start by receiving the customer's car repair request with photo via an API.  Designer automatically creates an API “Request” and “Response” node for your API flow.|
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review3](./images/demoscript-review-request.png) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.5 - Checking the Photo</summary>

<br/>

| **Checking the Photo** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Explore the *if* step (1) and click on **Salesforce Connector - Retrieve contacts** (2). |
| **Talking Points**      | Second, we validate the photo. Here, we have a really simple if statement, that check if the PhotoOfCar is empty. |
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review5](./images/demoscript-review-if.png) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.6 - Retrieve contacts</summary>

<br/>

| **Retrieve contacts** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Explore the *Salesforce Connector - Retrieve contacts* (1). Change the *Contact name* to **Andrew Young** (2). And **test** the connection (3). Change back the *Contact Full name* to **Andy Young** (4) and **test** again (5). Open **View details** (6). On the *Output*, open the **Contact1** object (7). **Close** all the dialog tabs. Click on the **Salesforce – Create case node** (8). |
| **Talking Points**      | Third, we use a connector to create a case in Salesforce with the date from the API. This Case is where we store the details and progress of our repair. We are using a hard-code contact: 'Andy Young'.  He's the contact for the insurance company that sends customers. Salesforce Developer Accounts have a prepopulated set of data that you can use to test. ‘Andy Young’ is one of those prepopulated contacts. Let's test our connection with Salesforce. Let me change here the contact to Andrew Young, and test the connection. Ok, the test shows that we don't have Andrew Young. Let's change back to Andy Young and test again. Great, now we received a success response. That prove that our connection is working. Let's check  the details. Here we can see the Output returned from SalesForce, including the Contact ID.  |
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![contacts1](./images/demoscript-contacts1.png) <br/> ![contacts2](./images/demoscript-contacts2.png) <br/> ![contacts3](./images/demoscript-contacts3.png) <br/> ![contacts4](./images/demoscript-contacts4.png) <br/> ![contacts5](./images/demoscript-contacts5.png)|

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.7 - Create Case</summary>

<br/>

| **Create Case** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Explore the *Salesforce – Create case node*. **Close** the Salesforce connector dialog. Open the **Salesforce - Create Attachment** node. |
| **Talking Points**      | Now we have the ID that we need, let’s create our Salesforce case. Note that we just re-use the same connector but with a different operation and data. Here we can see that our contact ID comes from the previous ‘retrieve contact’ Salesforce Call. The Name and email come from the API Request. The connector ‘knows’ that fields like ‘Case Type’ have a limited number of values in Salesforce – so it automatically converts them into pull-down lists of values for you to choose from. |
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review7](./images/demoscript-review-salesforce-createcase.png) |

<details>
<summary>3.8 - Create Attachment</summary>

<br/>

| **Create Attachment** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Explore the *Salesforce – Create Attachment node* (1). **Close** the Salesforce connector dialog. Open the **IBM Watson Tone Analyzer** node (2). |
| **Talking Points**      | To add a photograph, we need to create a salesforce attachment – that’s easy, just use the connector again. Note that we use the Case ID that is a returned value from the ‘Create Case’ connector call – it’s been kept in the flow automatically. We send the PhotoOfCar as a base64 string and we tell Salesforce that the content Type is image/jpeg. |
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review8](./images/demoscript-review-attachment.png) |

| **Analyze the description** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Explore the *Watson Tone Analyzer* connector (1). **Close** the Tone Analyzer connector dialog. Open the **Salesforce - Create case comment** (2). |
| **Talking Points**      | Here, the Watson Tone Analyzer services, analyse the description shared by the customer, to identify if the customer is angry or upset, that demands further action or treat them more carefully. |
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![review9](./images/demoscript-review-analyzer.png) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.10 - Create case comment</summary>

<br/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>3.11 - Response</summary>

<br/>

| **Response** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Explore the *Response* dialog (1). Click **Done** (2). |
| **Talking Points**      | Here, we have the response that we submit back to the customer after the API call. This response incluse their Salesforce case reference for future enquiries and also an estimate of how long it will take to repair and how much it will cost.  <br/>Great. we've built the flow, let's start it! |

In your script folder, on *terminal* window, *edit* the **00-variables** file (e.g.: *vi 00-variables*) and update the **BASEPATH** (7), **USERNAME** (8) and **PASSWORD** (9). Execute **source exportVariables.sh** (10) |
| **Talking Points**      | Now we’ve built our API, we need to test it. APIs can be tested in a number of different ways, for example using the IBM API Test and Monitor tool. During this demo, we do 3 different tests, one in the designer tool, another when our API is deployed to the Cloud Pak App Connect Runtime. And the last test, will be calling thru a Gateway. <br/> For simplicity and speed, as we’re using base64 pictures, we will use simple curl scripts so that we can call the APIs from the command line. Before go ahead and execute the script to call our API, we need to configure our script to point to our environment. To get the credentials for the designer, we go to the ‘Manage’ tab in designer. Now, let's change our variable files to use this credentials. Great, let's export now these variables.   |
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![](./images/demoscript-variables0.png) <br/> ![](./images/demoscript-variables1.png) <br/> ![](./images/demoscript-variables2.png)  <br/> ![](./images/demoscript-variables3.png) |

| :---         | :--- |
| **Actions**             | Into the *Designer Dashboard* (1), click the **menu** (2) and click **Export** (3).   Select **Runtime flow asset (BAR)** (4) and click **Export** (5).  |
| **Talking Points**      | To deploy the flow to an integration server, you must export it as a BAR file. All the configuration settings, other than the connection credentials for your accounts, are preserved in the exported archive. Let's export an executable bar file. From the dashboard, locate the flow, open its menu, and then click Export. When you export a flow, you can choose to export its configuration as a YAML or BAR file, or as an OpenAPI document. In our case, we export as a BAR File.  |
| **Screenshots**         | &nbsp;  <br/> ![](./images/demoscript-export-bar1.png) <br/> ![](./images/demoscript-export-bar2.png) |

| **Talking Points**      | Now, let's open the the App Connect Dashboard and create a new server. We need to create an integration server to run our integration. An integration server is a Kubernetes pod which has the containers needed to run our .bar file. Now we need to select the kind of tooling we used to build the integration. We used the Designer. Now, we just need to upload the BAR file that we exported from designer. And here we choose which configurations we want. Here we enter the information that we want for our Integration server. Great, let's create it!|
