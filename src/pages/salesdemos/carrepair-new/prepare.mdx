## Introduction

You are going to integrate with Salesforce and IBM Watson Tone Analyzer service. You need to have these services and endpoints created and all the credentials necessary to integrate to them securely in the demo.

IBM Watson can tell if someone is happy or sad or angry or many other emotions! If your customer is angry, you want to know so you can make them happy – you’ll use this to look at the customer’s description of the damage/problem and put the tone into our Salesforce case so that when we call them, we know what to expect.

Salesforce is a CRM system provided as a SaaS i.e. it is hosted in the cloud. In this scenario, we as a car repair company will use Salesforce to create and store our car repair claims.

## Setting up Watson Tone Analyzer

Great! Now you will start by setting up IBM Watson services. You will need an IBM Cloud account to do this. Once you have an account, all of the Watson services have ‘lite’ plans which allow you to use them for free. Let'see how to do it!

1.Open [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog) again, now with your personal account. Now, search and select the **Tone Analyzer**.

2.Select the free *Lite* plan and click *Create* to provision the service.

3.When the service is *active*, click on the **Manage** tab.

4.Here on the Manage tab, you are able to copy the **API Key** and the **URL** that you will need to integrate with the service. **Copy/paste** them somewhere for later use in this demo.

## Setting up Salesforce

Now, let's set up Salesforce. You will need a developer account to use for testing – if you already have a Salesforce developer account, you can use that – if not, you can sign up for a free developer account now.

1.Go to (https://developer.salesforce.com) and click on **Sign up**.

3.To get your Salesforce integration URL, click on your **user profile**. The URL text below your Account Name is your login URL. **Copy/paste** it somewhere for later use in this demo.

4.Next, you need to retrieve Security Token. For this, click on your **user profile** and select the **Settings** option in the profile panel.

Great, your Salesforce Dev account is ready, now let's configure CP4I to the services endpoints!

***

## Connecting CP4I to your endpoints

Now, let's configure our Services Endpoints in Cloud Pak for Integration. Let's do it!

1.Open your **Cloud Pak for Integration Home page** (if necessary, check [here](https://ibm-garage-tsa.github.io/cp4i-demohub/cp4i-on-roks/#install-cloud-pak-for-integration-on-roks-cluster) how to do it - step 11). On the Integrations area, click on **ace-designer-demo**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-home.png)

2.Open the **Catalog**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-catalog.png)

3.Here you can see a list of the available connectors.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-connectors.png)

4.Search for **Watson Tone Analyzer** and click **Connect**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-tone-connect.png)

5.Now you need to inform your **URL** and **API key**. Click **Connect** to create your account.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-tone-info.png)

6.Great! A connector account was created for you. However the integration flow that you will import later, it will look for a specific account. Because of that, you need to rename the account to work seamlessly. Let's rename the Account1. Click the three dots **menu** and click **Rename account**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-tone-rename.png)

7.In the dialog box, name the account **App Connect Trial** (exactly as shown – capitals on the first letter of the words, spaces between the words) and click **Rename Account**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-tone-rename2.png)

8.Great, now you have an *IBM Watson Tone Analyzer - App Connect Trial* account.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-tone-created.png)

9.Now, it's time to configure the Salesforce connection. Search for **Salesforce** and click **Connect**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-salesforce-connect.png)

10.Here you need to enter your Salesforce credentials. Insert the login URL into the connector account form as shown below.
   *IMPORTANT: You MUST enter the ‘https://’ part as well – it won’t work if you just copy/paste from the salesforce screen*.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-salesforce-login-details.png)

11.To populate the Password field on the connector account screen you will need to concatenate the Password used to log into the Salesforce account with the Security Token received via email.
   For example if you Salesforce password is ‘myGreatPassword’ and your Salesforce security token is ‘2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ then you should enter *‘myGreatPassword2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’* in the *password* field.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-salesforce-login-details2.png)

12.Use Salesforce's *Consumer Key* and *Secret* as **Client ID** and **Client Secret** respectively as needed in the connector account UI as follows and click **Connect**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-salesforce-login-details3.png)

13.Great! However you need to rename this account too. Click on **menu** and select **Rename account**.

![](./images/prepare/endpoint-salesforce-rename.png)

14.Enter **App Connect Trial** as *account name* and click **Rename Account**.

   Now, it is time to learn how to deliver the demo, by exploring the [300 Demo Script](/salesdemos/carrepair-new/300-demoscript) document.
