## Prepare the environment

### Task 1 - Prepare the environment

**Note: If your using this tutorial in a multi-user ROKS setup, the environment is already prepared for you. Please login to the cluster using LDAP authentication and the credentials provided by your instructor and jump to [Configuring IBM MQ](#task-2-configuring-mq). Also, maske sure that you use a prefix provided by the instructor for queue, topic and server names.**

Because this is a new deployment of the Cloud Pak for Integration that uses Red Hat OpenShift, you need to run some steps to prepare the environment. Initial setup steps are only needed for a fresh installation of the Cloud Pak. They do not need to be repeated.
