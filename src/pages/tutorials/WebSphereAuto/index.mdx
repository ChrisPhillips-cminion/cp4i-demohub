## Introduction

Organizations are challenged to transform quickly and maximize ROI, while keeping traditional and modern applications running together securely. Reclaiming productivity is key to giving teams back the time required to innovate and build resiliency.

Unfortunately, massive transformation programs are hard to greenlight and most fail to deliver immediate results. According to Gartner, AI augmentation will recover 6.2 billion hours of worker productivity in 20211 – time that can be invested in creating a solid and secure base for WebSphere transformation.

By leveraging AI and automation, organizations can achieve immediate savings and business benefits, while laying a solid and secure technology foundation for future growth.

With AI and automation, teams can modernize and secure their IT estate as well as adapt and respond to incidents efficiently. WebSphere system administrators can reduce the cost, effort, and risk of addressing vulnerabilities and anomalies, automate critical activities, preserve uptime and remediate capacity incidents.

IBM WebSphere Automation makes business efficiency and resiliency standard. It helps teams work less on maintenance tasks and gives time back to focus more on strategic activities, to extend the life, increase the ROI, and unlock new value from WebSphere investments.

IBM WebSphere Automation is a complete solution to help administrators and operators quickly unlock value with increased security, resiliency and performance.

**Secure operations to reduce risk and meet compliance**
  – Automatically recognize and recommend relevant CVEs for specific server deployments.
  – Deliver security patches more efficiently to targeted environments.
  – Maintain the notification system for all the security response team members from a central location.

**Build operational resiliency**
  – Sense and respond to security vulnerabilities faster to avoid disruptions for WebSphere apps.

**Optimize runtimes and applications for operational performance**
  – Access consolidated information for a streamlined operational experience.
  – Reduce tedious tasks and achieve cost and time savings through optimal resource utilization, capacity provisioning and implementation of best practices across environments.

**Start small, scale and standardize on IBM Automation**
  – Build automation capabilities on top of the IBM Automation foundation for enterprise-level hybrid application management, observability, governance and compliance.

IBM WebSphere Automation is available as a stand-alone offering or as an addition to IBM Cloud Pak® for Watson AIOps. As part of IBM Automation platform, IBM WebSphere Automation includes containerized components and common software services on top of a common automation layer, to manage WebSphere’s incidents, hybrid applications, and cost with complete observability, governance and compliance. Deploy virtually anywhere through containers supported by Red Hat® OpenShift® software, on IBM Cloud®, on essentially any existing infrastructure on-premises, or through private and public clouds. Use only the capabilities you need with a fully modular approach that’s designed to be easy to consume.

## Prerequisites

  - You need to have the WebSphere Automation Skytap Image. [Request here](/)

***

## Business Context

You are a WebSphere Administrator part of a WebSphere Operations Team. Today, you subscribe and receive IBM Security Bulletins to be aware about vulnerabilities, its potential impact, severity and recommended solutions. Based on that you check if this CVE applies to your managed inventory. Now, your inventory is a spreadsheet, with all the information about your servers, which versions, which operational system, which iFixes were applied, etc. It is very manual process and you are trying to automate it.

You would like to have:
- **Management dashboard:** Consolidated dashboard increases awareness and response time to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs).
- **Automated vulnerability tracking:** Let WebSphere Automation track new security bulletins across your existing traditional WebSphere and Liberty environments, on virtual machines or containers.
- **Contextual notifications:** Receive security bulletin notifications only when new vulnerabilities affect the environment you manage, reducing noise and interruptions to the WebSphere operations team.
- **Shared, live visibility to key stakeholders:** WebSphere operators and security compliance teams can see the real-time security posture of the WebSphere estate, accelerating action and minimizing the risk of miscommunication.

In this tutorial, you use the IBM WebSphere Automation to secure operatios to reduce risk and meet compliance.

At the end of this lab, you will be able to connect teams with the most relevant information through a single dashboard to discover, analyze and remediate common vulnerabilities and exposures across instances.

## Accessing and starting the environment

1.When the demo environment is provisioned you should receive the email with link and access password. Open the link and provide the password. You should see the following screen:

  ![](images/skytap-1.png)

  WebSphere Automation is pre-installed in the OCP cluster hosted on the VMs.

2.Start the environment with the Play button in the top-right corner. It takes about 10-15 minutes for the environment to start and stabilize.

  ![](images/skytap-2.png)

3.You will be working on the Student VM only. This VM is installed with OCP client (oc) and all thee scripts and files you need for the lab.

  All the WebSphere images and iFixes required for the lab are pre-installed:
    * /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/
    * /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty20009/
    * /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer9057/
    * /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer9056/

  Click the screen representing the **STUDENT** VM.

  ![](images/student-vm.png)

4.Once you log in to the Student VM you will see the Desktop, which contains all the programs that you will be using (browsers, terminal, etc.)

  ![](images/student-vm-screen.png)

5.You can resize the virtual desktop with the Fit to window button.

## Receiving vulnerability notifications

### Access the GUI

* WebSphere Automation is pre-installed on an OCP cluster.
* Each of you have access to your individual WebSphere Automation installation.
* Click the Student VM.
* Open a browser and enter the following URL:
  * `https://cpd-websphere-automation.apps.ocp.ibm.edu`
  * Accept all the warnings and certificates. Depending on your browser, you might have to scroll down to permit access.

### Log in to the GUI

* This is the initial landing page for IBM automation
  * Under Log in to IBM Automation -> Select your authentication type: click OpenShift authentication

  ![](images/ibm-auto-login.png)

  * Enter the following credentials
    * UserName : ocadmin
    * Password : ibmocp46

### Check GUI content and configure email notification

* Click the Navigation/Hamburger Menu on the left.

  ![](images/hamburger-menu.png)

* Click Operate.
  * You should now see Application Runtimes. Click that.

  ![](images/app-runtime-nav.png)

* It will take you to the WebSphere Automation GUI.
  * There should be no data since no WebSphere servers are registered/configured yet.

* On the console, go to Notification Configuration and enter your email address where you want to be notified about CVEs by clicking add email address button
  * The mail server is pre-configured for this lab. You only need to enter your email address to get notified.

su root
```

* Enter the following password when prompted:

```
1bm2021rhjb
```

* Log in to the OCP cluster (in each terminal) 
```
oc login --username=ocadmin --password=ibmocp46 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true --server=https://api.ocp.ibm.edu:6443
```
* Make sure that the project you are working on is websphere-automation:</br>

```
oc project websphere-automation
