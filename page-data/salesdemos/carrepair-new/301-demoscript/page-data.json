IBM Cloud Pak for Integration is a hybrid integration solution that provides an automated and closed-loop lifecycle across multiple styles of enterprise integration. With IBM Cloud Pak for Integration, companies can speed integration development, reduce costs and maintain enhanced security, governance and availability. Let's see IBM Cloud Pak for Integration in action. Here I have a cloud version of the product on IBM Cloud.
