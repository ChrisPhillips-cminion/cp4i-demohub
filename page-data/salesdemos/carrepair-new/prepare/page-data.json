You need to have these services and endpoints created and all the credentials necessary to integrate to them securely in the demo.\n\nIBM Watson can tell if someone is happy or sad or angry or many other emotions!

In this scenario, we as a car repair company will use Salesforce to create and store our car repair claims.\n\n***\n\n## Setting up Watson Tone Analyzer\n\nGreat!
